  creating this website is more than just an exercise-it's a way to showcase my progress,express my creativityand build a solid foundation for my future career.
  for a future in tech.</p>

<p>This is my very first portfolio website,and im proud to be coding from scratch. Each section reflects a bit of who iam and what i'm learning. I am driven by curiosity,
  dedication,and a strong desire to grow into a well rounded developer.Wheather im buliding simple layouts or complex applications, I approach each project with enthusiasm
  and a willingness to learn and push myself beyond limits.</p>

<p>Outside of coding,i enjoy playing vidoes games and alos watch some movies and also open to any random knowledged like a lifehack.
  and i try to bring that same passion and creativity in everything i do.My goal is to keep learning and keep building and one day create solutions that truky impacts peoples lives.
  Thank you for visiting my site-I hope you will follow along as i continue ro grow ans share my journey.</p>
